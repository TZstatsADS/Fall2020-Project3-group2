# Project 2: Shiny App Development

### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs).

- cross_validation.R: starter code for cross validation
- cross_validation_gbm.R: cross validation R code for GBM model using in the main.Rmd file 
- cross_validation_KNN.R: cross validation R code for KNN model using in the main_KNN.Rmd file 
- cross_validation_xgb.R: cross validation R code for XGBoost model using in the main.Rmd file 
- feature_improved.R: extract the features using Principal component analysis (PCA) method.
- feature: starter code for extracting the features 
- load.py: load data for VGG16 model in the VGG16 Model.ipynb
- SVM_model_weighted.R: contains R code for cross validation, training improved SVM model and testing improved SVM in the main_SVM.Rmd file
- SVM_model.R: contains R code for cross validation, training SVM model and testing SVM in the main_SVM.Rmd file
- test_gbm.R: tesing R code for GBM model using in the main.Rmd file 
- test_xgb.R: tesing R code for XGBoost model using in the main.Rmd file 
- test.R: starter code for testing data
- train_gbm.R: traing R code for GBM model using in the main.Rmd file 
- train_KNN.R: traing R code for GBM model using in the main_KNN.Rmd file 
- train_xgb.R: traing R code for GBM model using in the main.Rmd file
